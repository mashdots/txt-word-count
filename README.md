This is a small project I wrote to parse a text file and then tell you which word was used the most.

# Dependencies
Currently, the JavaScript version uses v1.1.8 of `progress`, which allows a neat-o progress bar.

This will be updated as I work with other languages. Ruby and Python are upcoming.

### Changelog

*18/03/08* Initial commit with JavaScript script and 2 test files. Both files were retrieved from [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org/).
